I found the following amazing repositories:
- https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js
- https://github.com/emrebulbul23/GridNav-java
- https://github.com/JonZarate/JumpPointSearch-With-UI

The first one implements multiple path finding algorithms, and provide a web demo. But it is a Javascript implementation.

The second one implements several path finding algorithms in Java. But it doesn't provide demo.

The third one implements several path finding algorithms in Java either, and provides demo UI. But its implements don't perform as well as the first one.

Thus, I'll implement another Java repository of path finding algorithms and provide demo UI, based on the above repositories.
